# The-Cycle-Interactive-Map #  
Create custom contracts map for The Cycle

-----  

You can see the app runing [here](https://thecyclemapcreator.go.yj.fr/index.html).  

## How it works ? ##  

Click on item on the right and they will appear on the left map.  
You can drag and drop item on the map. You can't do that on evacuation, uplink and central station.  

You can also change the "state" of a contracts when you click on it (drones, evacuation, uplink).  

*Warning: if you change map it will clear the previous map*  

## Future updates : ##  

* More spawn location for solo, duo and squad on both map
* Spawn location for 1k and drill
* Better random map generator
* Better uplink next icon
* Multi-language support (Mostly French ðŸ¥–)
* Better pain train management (Slider on the map)  

## Things that doesn't work currently : ##  

* Uplink rotation on random map (it change with drone or power station)
* Delete a specific contracts (Possible fix : Leaflet unique id for each icon)
* Change drone state change only the last drone (Possible fix : Leaflet unique id for each icon)
