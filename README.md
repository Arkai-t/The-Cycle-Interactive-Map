# The-Cycle-Interactive-Map #  
Create custom contracts map for The Cycle

-----  

You can see the app runing [here](https://thecyclemapcreator.go.yj.fr/index.html).  

## How it works ? ##  

Click on item on the right and they will appear on the left map  
You can drag and drop item on the map. You can't do that on evacuation, uplink, central station  

*Warning: if you change map it will clear the previous map*  

## Future updates : ##  

* More spawn location for solo, duo and squad on both map
* Spawn location for 1k and drill
* Better random map generator
* Better uplink next icon
* Multi-language support (Mostly French ðŸ¥–)

## Things that doesn't work currently : ##  

* Pain Train
* Uplink rotation on random map (it change with drone or power station)
* Change state of drones (Pick up / Launching)
* Delete a specific contracts (Possible fix : Leaflet unique id for each icon)
